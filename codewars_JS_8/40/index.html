            As a treat, I'll let you read part of 
            the script from a classic 
            'I'm Alan Partridge episode:
            
            Lynn: Alan, there’s that teacher chap.
            Alan: Michael, if he hits me, will you hit him first?
            Michael: No, he’s a customer. I cannot hit customers. 
            I’ve been told. I’ll go and get some stock.
            Alan: Yeah, chicken stock.
            Phil: Hello Alan.
            Alan: Lynn, hand me an apple pie. And remove yourself 
            from the theatre of conflict.
            Lynn: What do you mean?
            Alan: Go and stand by the yakults. The temperature inside this apple 
            turnover is 1,000 degrees. If I squeeze it, a jet of molten Bramley 
            apple is going to squirt out. Could go your way, could go mine. Either 
            way, one of us is going down.
            
            Alan is known for referring to the temperature of the apple turnover 
            as Hotter than the sun!. According to space.com the temperature of the 
            sun's corona is 2,000,000 degrees Celsius, but we will ignore the science 
            for now.
            Task
            
            Your job is simple, if x squared is more than 1000, return It's hotter than 
            the sun!!, else, return Help yourself to a honeycomb Yorkie for the glovebox.
            
            Note: Input will either be a positive integer
             (or a string for untyped languages).
