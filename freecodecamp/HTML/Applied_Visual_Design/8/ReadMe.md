## Create a Horizontal Line Using the hr Element ##

<p>You can use the hr tag to add a horizontal line across the width of its containing element. This can be used to define a change in topic or to visually separate groups of content.
<HR>
Add an hr tag underneath the h4 which contains the card title.

Note: In HTML, hr is a self-closing tag, and therefore doesn't need a separate closing tag.
