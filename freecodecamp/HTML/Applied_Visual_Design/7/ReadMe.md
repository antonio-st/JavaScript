## Use the s Tag to Strikethrough Text ##


<p>To strikethrough text, which is when a horizontal line cuts across the characters, you can use the s tag. It shows that a section of text is no longer valid. With the s tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: line-through; to the element.</p>

<p> Wrap the s tag around Google inside the h4 tag and then add the word Alphabet beside it without the strikethrough formatting.</p>
